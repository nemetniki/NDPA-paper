@article{Drummond1990,
abstract = {We develop the quantum theory of a driven, damped intracavity parametric oscillator in the case of nondegenerate signal and idler modes. An analysis of the results of different types of local-oscillator measurements on the outgoing modes is presented. The frequency-domain squeezing is calculated below threshold including the effect of detunings and nonequal decay rates. We also calculate a nonclassical correlation in the quadrature amplitudes of the output beams. The existence of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox is demonstrated through violations of the inferred Heisenberg uncertainty principle at causally unrelated locations in the output field. This provides a way of maintaining the commutation relations of the measured operators in the exact form envisaged originally by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.},

@article{Pyragas1992,
abstract = {Two methods of chaos control with a small time continuous perturbation are proposed. The stabilization of unstable periodic orbits of a chaotic system is achieved either by combined feedback with the use of a specially designed external oscillator, or by delayed self-controlling feedback without using of any external force. Both methods do not require an a priori analytical knowledge of the system dynamics and are applicable to experiment. The delayed feedback control does not require any computer analyses of the system and can be particularly convenient for an experimental application.},

abstract = {We consider a system consisting of N nondegenerate optical parametric$\backslash$namplifiers (NOPAs) operating below threshold and linked with each other$\backslash$nin a cascading way, each taking the output subharmonic fields from the$\backslash$nprevious one as the input fields. The entanglement properties of the$\backslash$nsubharmonic fields from these cascading nondegenerate optical parametric$\backslash$namplifiers (CNOPAs) are investigated. We find that, if the input$\backslash$nsubharmonic fields of the first NOPA in the cascading line are in the$\backslash$nvacuum state, the output fields from the later NOPAs exhibit excellent$\backslash$nbroadband entanglement, and the entanglement frequency band is broadened$\backslash$nnotably with increased number of cascading NOPAs. We also discuss the$\backslash$napplication of the entangled light generated from the CNOPAs to$\backslash$nbroadband teleportation, and find that the maximum width of the fidelity$\backslash$nspectrum of teleportation of broadband coherent states can be greatly$\backslash$nbroadened.},

The possibility for significantly enhanced squeezing is demonstrated both on resonance and in sidebands, at a reduced pump power compared to the case without feedback.We study a broad range of operating parameters and their influence on the characteristic squeezing of the system. A classical analysis of the system dynamics reveals the connection between the feedback-modified landscape of stability and enhanced squeezing.},
