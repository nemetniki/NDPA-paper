@article{Caves1985,
abstract = {This paper introduces a new formalism for analyzing two-photon devices (e.g., parametric amplifiers and phase-conjugate mirrors), in which photons in the output modes are created or destroyed two at a time. The key property of a two-photon device is that it excites pairs of output modes independently. Thus our new formalism deals with two modes at a time; a continuum multimode description can be built by integrating over independently excited pairs of modes. For a pair of modes at frequencies $\Omega$±$\epsilon$, we define (i) quadrature-phase amplitudes, which are complex-amplitude operators for modulation at frequency $\epsilon$ of waves ‘‘cos[$\Omega$(t-x/c)]'' and ‘‘sin[$\Omega$(t-x/c)]'' and (ii) two-mode squeezed states, which are the output states of an ideal two-photon device. The quadrature-phase amplitudes and the two-mode squeezed states serve as the building blocks for our formalism; their properties and their physical interpretation are extensively investigated.},

Analogous calculations are performed for the nondegenerate parametric amplifier, and particular attention is given to the effects of correlations between the light beams formed from the two frequency components.

The frequency-domain squeezing is calculated below threshold including the effect of detunings and nonequal decay rates. We also calculate a nonclassical correlation in the quadrature amplitudes of the output beams. The existence of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox is demonstrated through violations of the inferred Heisenberg uncertainty principle at causally unrelated locations in the output field. This provides a way of maintaining the commutation relations of the measured operators in the exact form envisaged originally by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.},

abstract = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufFicient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

Such a system is analogous to and under some ideal conditions is in one-to-one correspondence with the original system discussed by EPR. In particular, the quadrature-phase amplitudes for a signal beam are inferred in turn from those of a spatially separated but strongly correlated idler beam, where these optical amplitudes are analogous to canonical position and momentum variables. The variances for the two inferences are measured and their product is observed to be below the limit of unity associated with the Heisenberg un- certainty relation, in apparent contradiction with quantum mechanics according to the argument of EPR. The smallest product of inference variances achieved in the experiment is (0.70 4- 0.01). Various other types of quantum noise for this system are also investigated, and a theory of a narrow- band NOPA is presented with losses included. A comparison between experiment and this theory shows relatively good agreement. The question of a local hidden-variables descrip- tion of the system is discussed.},
