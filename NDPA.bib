abstract = {We experimentally demonstrated that the quantum correlations of amplitude and phase quadratures between signal and idler beams produced from a non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) can be significantly improved by using a mode cleaner in the pump field and reducing the phase fluctuations in phase locking systems. Based on the two technical improvements the quantum entanglement measured with a two-mode homodyne detector is enhanced from {\~{}} 4 dB to {\~{}} 6 dB below the quantum noise limit using the same NOPA and nonlinear crystal.},

The entanglement properties of the$\backslash$nsubharmonic fields from these cascading nondegenerate optical parametric$\backslash$namplifiers (CNOPAs) are investigated. We find that, if the input$\backslash$nsubharmonic fields of the first NOPA in the cascading line are in the$\backslash$nvacuum state, the output fields from the later NOPAs exhibit excellent$\backslash$nbroadband entanglement, and the entanglement frequency band is broadened$\backslash$nnotably with increased number of cascading NOPAs.

@article{Ou1992,
abstract = {The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox is demonstrated experimentally for continuous variables by employing a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier (NOPA). Such a system is analogous to and under some ideal conditions is in one-to-one correspondence with the original system discussed by EPR. In particular, the quadrature-phase amplitudes for a signal beam are inferred in turn from those of a spatially separated but strongly correlated idler beam, where these optical amplitudes are analogous to canonical position and momentum variables. The variances for the two inferences are measured and their product is observed to be below the limit of unity associated with the Heisenberg un- certainty relation, in apparent contradiction with quantum mechanics according to the argument of EPR. The smallest product of inference variances achieved in the experiment is (0.70 4- 0.01). Various other types of quantum noise for this system are also investigated, and a theory of a narrow- band NOPA is presented with losses included. A comparison between experiment and this theory shows relatively good agreement. The question of a local hidden-variables descrip- tion of the system is discussed.},

abstract = {We develop the quantum theory of a driven, damped intracavity parametric oscillator in the case of nondegenerate signal and idler modes. An analysis of the results of different types of local-oscillator measurements on the outgoing modes is presented. The frequency-domain squeezing is calculated below threshold including the effect of detunings and nonequal decay rates. We also calculate a nonclassical correlation in the quadrature amplitudes of the output beams. The existence of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox is demonstrated through violations of the inferred Heisenberg uncertainty principle at causally unrelated locations in the output field. This provides a way of maintaining the commutation relations of the measured operators in the exact form envisaged originally by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.},

The stabilization of unstable periodic orbits of a chaotic system is achieved either by combined feedback with the use of a specially designed external oscillator, or by delayed self-controlling feedback without using of any external force. Both methods do not require an a priori analytical knowledge of the system dynamics and are applicable to experiment. The delayed feedback control does not require any computer analyses of the system and can be particularly convenient for an experimental application.},
